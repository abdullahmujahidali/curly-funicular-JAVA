Define a Pet class that stores the pet's name, age, and weight. Add approximate constructors, accessor, and mutator function. Also define a function named getLifespan(length of time for which a person or animal lives or a thing function) that returns a string with value"unknown lifespan." Next, define a Dog class that derived from Pet. the Dog class should have a private member variable named breed that stores the breed of the dog. Add mutator and accessor functions for the breed variable and appropriate constructions. Redefine the getLifespan function to return " approximately 7 years " if the dog's weight is over 100 pounds and " approximately 13 years " if the dogâ€™s weight is under 100 pounds. Next define a Rock class that is derived from Pet. Redefine the getLifespan function to return "thousands of years". Finally, write a test program that creates instances pf pet rocks and pet dogs that exercises that inherited and redefine functions.
